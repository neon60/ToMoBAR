Installation Guide
------------------
ToMoBAR is a Python package with several :ref:`ref_dependencies` to ensure its full functionality.
It mostly relies on the GPU-enabled computations and therefore we suggest having a decent NVIDIA
graphics card to support it.

.. _ref_python:

Python
======

Install ToMoBAR as a pre-built conda Python package:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: console

   $ conda install -c httomo tomobar

or install with the main dependencies into a new environment:

.. code-block:: console

   $ conda install -c httomo -c conda-forge tomophantom tomobar astra-toolbox ccpi-regulariser pypwt

Install ToMoBAR from PyPi:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
One can install ToMoBAR from PyPi, however, not all dependencies might be at PyPi yet.

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install tomobar

Create conda environment:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
Sometimes the one-liner above doesn't work. In that case we suggest creating a new conda environment,
and **pip** install ToMoBAR into it as shown bellow.

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone git@github.com/dkazanc/ToMoBAR.git # clone the repo
   $ conda env create --name tomobar --file conda-recipe/environment/environment.yml
   $ conda activate tomobar
   $ pip install .

Developers environment
+++++++++++++++++++++++
This sets the development environment to work in-place on the code.

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone git@github.com/dkazanc/ToMoBAR.git # clone the repo
   $ conda env create --name tomobar --file conda-recipe/environment/environment.yml
   $ conda activate tomobar
   $ pip install -e .[dev] # the editable environment
   $ pytests tests/ # all tests should pass

Conda builds
+++++++++++++
If one needs to conda-build the package, please follow the steps bellow:

.. code-block:: console

   $ export VERSION=$(date +%Y.%m) # OR set VERSION=2024.01 for Windows
   $ git clone git@github.com/dkazanc/ToMoBAR.git # clone the repo
   $ conda build conda-recipe/
   $ conda install path/to/the/tarball

.. _ref_matlab:

Matlab
======
Matlab part of ToMoBAR is not currently maintained and will be deprecated in future releases.
The code and Demos we provide have been tested with Matlab 2018 and ASTRA-Toolbox version v1.8.3.
